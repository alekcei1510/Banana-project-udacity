**DRLND Banana Navigation Project**

This project reflects the knowledge acquired of the first module of reinforcemente learning with an applied project.   

The main objective of the banana navigation problem itÂ´s to collect yellow bananas and avoid the blue ones. To complete successfully the change, the agent needs to perform above an average of 13 points over 100 episodes.  

## Instructions to run the project 

### Dependencies

To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below.

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.


- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd
	```
- __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
	activate drlnd
	```
	
2. If running in **Windows**, ensure you have the "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019" installed from this [site](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).  This [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-install-openai-gym-in-a-windows-environment-338969e24d30) may also be very helpful.  This was confirmed to work in Windows 10 Home.  

3. Follow the instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/openai/gym) to perform a minimal install of OpenAI gym.  
	- Next, install the **classic control** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#classic-control).
	- Then, install the **box2d** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#box2d).
	
4. Clone the repository (if you haven't already!), and navigate to the `python/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies.  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning.git
    cd deep-reinforcement-learning/python
    pip install .
    ```

5. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `drlnd` environment.    
    ```bash
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
    ```

6. Before running code in a notebook, change the kernel to match the `drlnd` environment by using the drop-down `Kernel` menu.
